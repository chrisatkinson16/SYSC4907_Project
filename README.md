SYSC 4907 Smart Office for User Safety and Comfort Project
----------------------------------------------------------

-------------------
Project Description
-------------------

A smart office environment can provide users with both comfort and safety. Indeed, the use of the internet of things (IoT) for smart offices can provide a high level of comfort for its users. Furthermore, taking advantage of social media and other data sources about the latest safety measures, provide the user with a safe working environment. In this project, we combine the use of IoT and social media data in order to increase users’ comfort levels, provide a safe working environment, and optimize the available resources.

As part of the project, the team will design, implement, and deploy an IoT-enabled smart office environment. This includes (i) sensors’ selection and integration, (ii) communication between the sensor nodes, the edge, and the cloud, (iii) IoT and social media data collection, and (iv) making controls and providing recommendations to the users.
